# Initial Guidelines

Please make sure that your changes are appropriately tested with unit tests
covering each phase of translation in the compiler, and that your changes
conform to the [LVLM Coding Standards](llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst).

Verify your changes by building and testing using the
cmake/caches/PredefinedParams.cmake file with CMake's -C flag to configure the
build. Test the compiler and runtime support with the targets: check-all.

Break your changes into small code changes with each change committed
spearately. Record your thought process into a file named "agent_thoughts.md" at
the root of the repository and commit it in its own commit when you're done.

# Request

1) Add a test verifying that the rewriter does not modify the file at all if
   there are no attributed functions.
2) Add tests that handle user functions which call other user functions which
   may not be attributed correctly.
